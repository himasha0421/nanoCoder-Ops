# nanoCoder-Ops
end to end nano LLM based model Supervised fine tuned on coding scripts , Reward model training &amp; finally LORA fine tuned on python language , add mlops ontop of the development


ROADMAP :

### step 1. select proper model applicable for the use case
### step 2. select proper dataset and codebase for SFT . Reward Modeling and RLHF traning

### step 3. apply MLOps
